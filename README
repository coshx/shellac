Shellac is an Eclipse Plugin that can be added to Java projects 
in order to add protective dynamic checks, as well as static analysis,
to ensure the project meets its safety requirements. Shellac allows for 
a hybrid approach of the dynamic checks and static analysis so that they
may be interchanged.

SETUP
=====

In order to install this plugin, it must be exported as a jar 
(plugin with fragments and aspectJ support), then this jar must be added
as to the build path of the project you wish to protect.
The jar must also be added to the AspectJ aspect path, but this can easily
be done by right clicking on the jar in the Project References and selecting
to add it to the aspect path.


TODO
====

This plugin should provide a single menu item to convert it to a Shellac project,
which should bring in AspectJ support, the necessary project references, and setup
the apsectj path.
