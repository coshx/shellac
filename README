Shellac is an Eclipse Plugin that can be added to Java projects 
in order to add protective dynamic checks, as well as static analysis,
to ensure the project meets its safety requirements. Shellac allows for 
a hybrid approach of the dynamic checks and static analysis so that they
may be interchanged.

SETUP
=====

In order to install this plugin, it must be exported as a jar 
(plugin with fragments and aspectJ support), then this jar must be added
as to the build path of the project you wish to protect.
The jar must also be added to the AspectJ aspect path, but this can easily
be done by right clicking on the jar in the Project References and selecting
to add it to the aspect path.

Once installed, be sure to bring up the Tasks view to see the proof obligations.


TODO
====

This plugin should provide a single menu item to convert it to a Shellac project,
which should bring in AspectJ support, the necessary project references, and setup
the apsectj path.



Known Issues
============

1. there are issues with the KnowledgeBase updating properly (you have to open 
all the files in a project to get all the annotations)

2. the task markers are getting deleted when marked complete. they should only be
deleted if the proof obligations change.

3. the dynamic checker can only handle simple params (and simple arrays) when it 
has to copy them (ReqVars that have isOutput == true must be copied before they
are mutated). We need a way to plugin a way of copying or cloning objects.

4. a check in a class other than the class that has the Satisfies annotation will
not be found / executed
